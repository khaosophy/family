		<h3>Parking and Tent Location</h3>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Guests must park in the main parking lot behind the farm store.</p>
		<p><em>Check back soon for tent location.</em></p>
		<!-- <p>Look for us in tent <strong>PEACOCK</strong>.</p> -->
		
		<h2>What can we gift?</h2>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">No gifts, please! Her favorite thing is just being outside with friends and family.</p>
		<p>If you really want to give something, consider contributing to <a href="https://accounts.franklintempleton.com/investor/college/-1lYU" target="_blank">Eliza's college fund</a> or donating to <a href="/donate">one of these charities</a>.</p>

		<h2>Agenda</h2>

		<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
			<li>11:00am: Hello & Hugs!</li>
			<li>11:30am: Apple Picking!</li>
			<li>12:30pm: Lunch</li>
			<!-- <li>1pm: Elmo? (TBD, but secret!)</li> -->
			<li>1:30pm: Happy Birthday Desserts</li>
			<li>1:45pm: Goodie Bags & Good Byes</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We have the private tent until 2, but that doesn't mean we have to leave at that point! Other activities on the farm include visiting the animals, riding the train, climbing a hay pyramid, exploring an evergreen maze, or just checkout out the shop for fresh yummies.</p>

		<!-- <h3>A Note on Rain</h3> -->
		<!-- <p>It is expected to rain for the duration of the party, but we plan to proceed regardless. We have a tent for hanging out and eating, and the wagon to the fruit picking is covered. We will provide rain ponchos to those of you coming to the fields. Nonetheless, it may be wise to bring a raincoat/umbrella (and extra socks)!</p> -->

		<h2>Food</h2>
		<p>TBD, but probably just pizza this year.</p>

		<h2>What else should we know?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The venue is outside, under a tent, so dress appropriately.</li>
			<li>Party is rain or shine.</li>
			<li>Wear comfortable walking shoes, especially if you plan to come fruit picking.</li>
			<li>No alcohol is allowed on site.</li>
		</ul>
