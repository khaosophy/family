		<h3 class="h5 mt-5">Notes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>All day bottles are now whole milk. Her midnight bottle is still formula (see below).</li>
			<li>She can drink water from a open face cup (with help) or from a straw.</li>
			<li>She almost never takes more than one nap a day, and often doesn't even take the one. If she doesn't go down for the morning nap, you can try one again in the afternoon, but we don't sweat it much anymore.</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h2 class="h5 mt-5">Night Feeds</h2>
		<p>She will usually wake up once a night for a 6 oz. bottle of formula.</p>
